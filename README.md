### Idea -
There are a lot of people who can't speak, our project will help them to communicate with other people. Basically this software is used to convert American Sign Language to Text format. We will take in video feed from the webcam and convert that to the desired letter/number.
### Tools and technology used -
* Python3
    * Keras (For Machine Learning)
    * Open-CV (For preprocessing images and accessing the webcam)
### How to run the application -
* First download all the required libraries using the command - pip install requirements.txt.
* After this simply run LiveVideoFeed.py using python.
* Place your hand in the blue box to get the predictions.
### Description and Future Scope -
* This application can be further extended to predict actions in ASL as currently it is working only for numbers.
* We can also add this as a plugin to softwares like Skype so that dumb people can easily use it to communicate and express their thoughts to other non-ASL speaking users.
